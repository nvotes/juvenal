**juvenal** is an universal election verifier for the web browser. It is voting system agnostic, and allows anyone to verify an election record  of multiple voting systems. The proofs verification is implemented in [juvenal-lib].

It enables the verification of election ballots, tallies, and proofs generated by multiple voting solutions. It has been developed independently by the [nVotes] Online Voting team and is written in TypeScript. It also includes a command line verifier. It currently only supports verifying [ElectionGuard]. Work for supporting [Helios Voting] is in the works.

**WARNING**: This software is in development and is incomplete and most probably
contains bugs. Please do not use in production..
